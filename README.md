Some personal projects built while learning Arduino

This repo is being used as a personal storage of my projects. Code is absolutely not production-ready but you're allowed to use it as a starting point for any project. I'll try to include schematics for some projects.

Most of this stuff is based on the PDFs and examples for Elegoo Super Starter Kit
